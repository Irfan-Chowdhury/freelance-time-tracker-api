# üïí Freelance Time Tracker API

</div>

A Laravel 10+ RESTful API that enables freelancers to track and manage work hours across clients and projects, with reporting, PDF export, tagging, and daily notifications.



## Project Overview

This API allows registered freelancers to:
- Manage their **clients** and **projects**
- Start, stop, and manually log **work time**
- View and filter time logs by **day**, **week**, **project**, and **client**
- Export logs to **PDF**
- Use **tags** (e.g. `billable`, `non-billable`) for classification
- Get **email notifications** when 8+ hours are logged in a day

Built with **Laravel Sanctum** for authentication, Eloquent ORM, and JSON API standards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Irfan-Chowdhury/freelance-time-tracker-api.git

cd freelance-time-tracker-api
````

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
composer install

cp .env.example .env

php artisan key:generate
```

3. **Configure `.env`**

Update your database, mail, queue connection and other credentials.

4. **Run migrations and seeders**

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

###  Queue Configuration (for Email Notifications)

Email notifications (when a user logs more than 8 hours in a day) are sent **asynchronously using Laravel queues**. Follow these steps to configure:

5. **Set queue connection**


In your `.env`:

```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

Then run:

```bash
php artisan config:cache
```

6. **Create Jobs Table**

<!-- ```bash
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate
``` -->
    Already created in migrations.

7. **Start Queue Worker**

Run this in a separate terminal:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

>  This is needed to process the email jobs (like the daily hour notification).

8. **Serve the app**

```bash
php artisan serve
```

<br>

## API Authentication (Sanctum)

* All API routes (except login/register) are protected by **Laravel Sanctum**.
* Use `/api/register` and `/api/login` to get an access token.
* Attach `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header for all authenticated routes.
---

<br>


## Rate Limiting (Throttle)
* All authenticated API requests are rate limited using Laravel‚Äôs `throttle` middleware.
* By default, a user can make **60 requests per minute**.
* If exceeded, the API returns `429 Too Many Requests`.
* This protects the system from abuse and ensures fair usage.
---

<br>

## Performance Notes

* To optimize reporting queries, indexes have been added on `start_time` and `end_time` columns in the `time_logs` table.
* This improves the efficiency of date-based filtering and aggregation (e.g., total hours per day/week/month).
* Eloquent relationships are eager-loaded where needed to reduce N+1 query problems.

## Extra Features

### ‚úÖ PDF Export

* Export logs as a downloadable PDF
* Endpoint:

```http
GET /api/time-logs/pdf
```

### ‚úÖ Tags for Logs

### ‚úÖ Email Notifications
